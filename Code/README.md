📘 Algorithm Course – Python Code Collection
🧠 Overview
This folder contains Python scripts for a 12-week course on algorithms and related concepts in mathematics and computer science. Each script provides beginner-friendly, well-commented implementations of the key algorithms or data structures covered weekly. Real-life inspired examples make the content practical and easy to understand.

📂 Contents
Each file focuses on a specific topic and includes example inputs and printed outputs:

Week 1 – week1_bubble_insertion.py
Topics: Bubble Sort & Insertion Sort
Example: Sort student heights [160, 175, 155, 180, 165] and playing cards [5, 2, 8, 1].

Week 2 – week2_merge_quick.py
Topics: Merge Sort & Quick Sort
Example: Sort exam scores [65, 90, 50, 80, 70, 95, 60, 85] and cards [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3].

Week 3 – week3_linear_binary.py
Topics: Linear Search & Binary Search
Example: Search for book ID 42 and page 42 in a sorted list.

Week 4 – week4_recursion.py
Topics: Recursion (Factorial & Fibonacci)
Example: Calculate 5! and the 6th Fibonacci number.

Week 5 – week5_bfs_dfs.py
Topics: BFS & DFS (Graph Traversal)
Example: Traverse a graph from node A to D with connections like A→B, B→D.

Week 6 – week6_dijkstra_kruskal.py
Topics: Dijkstra's & Kruskal’s Algorithms
Example: Find shortest paths and minimum spanning trees in a city network.

Week 7 – week7_dynamic_programming.py
Topics: Dynamic Programming
Example: Compute optimized Fibonacci, Coin Change, and solve 0/1 Knapsack.

Week 8 – week8_data_structures.py
Topics: Stack, Queue, Min-Heap
Example: Manage books (stack), bus lines (queue), and tasks (heap priority).

Week 9 – week9_sieve_euclidean.py
Topics: Sieve of Eratosthenes & Euclidean Algorithm
Example: Find primes up to 10 and GCD of 48 and 18.

Week 10 – week10_combinatorics.py
Topics: Permutations & Combinations
Example: Generate all permutations and combinations of ['A', 'B', 'C'].

Week 11 – week11_huffman_pagerank.py
Topics: Huffman Coding & PageRank
Example: Compress the message "AABBCC" and rank webpages using simple link structures.

Week 12 – week12_rsa_gradient.py
Topics: RSA Encryption & Gradient Descent
Example: Encrypt/decrypt the number 9 and minimize x² starting from x=10.

▶️ How to Use
Requirements: Python 3.x installed. Uses only standard libraries like collections and heapq.

Run: Use python filename.py to execute any script.

Edit & Experiment: You can change the example inputs inside each file to test your own cases.

Output: Each script prints results clearly in the console.

Best Used With: Any Python environment—terminal, VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.

💬 Notes
The code is simple, clean, and self-contained—ideal for self-study, teaching, or workshops.

Designed with real-life analogies to make concepts intuitive.

No frameworks or external packages needed—just open, run, and learn!
