📘 Algorithm Course Slides
Overview
This repository contains a 12-week series of educational slides designed to teach core concepts in algorithms and related areas of mathematics and technology. The slides are aimed at beginner to intermediate learners and focus on intuitive explanations, real-world examples, and step-by-step breakdowns of each topic.

🔍 What's Inside
Each week of the course is represented by a PDF slide deck, covering topics from basic sorting to encryption. Here's a summary of what's included:

Week 1 – Introduction to Algorithms
Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and understanding algorithm complexity (Big O, Ω, Θ).
Example: Sorting students by height and arranging cards.

Week 2 – Divide and Conquer
Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
Example: Sorting exam scores and shuffling cards efficiently.

Week 3 – Searching Algorithms
Linear Search and Binary Search.
Example: Looking up a book ID or finding a page in a sorted catalog.

Week 4 – Recursion
Recursive thinking with Factorial and Fibonacci examples.
Example: Computing 5! and the 6th Fibonacci number.

Week 5 – Graph Traversal
BFS and DFS explained through pathfinding in a maze.
Example: Navigating from room A to D.

Week 6 – Graph Algorithms
Dijkstra’s and Kruskal’s Algorithms.
Example: Finding the shortest route in a city and building a road network.

Week 7 – Dynamic Programming
Optimized approaches to Fibonacci, Coin Change, and the 0/1 Knapsack problem.
Example: Maximizing value while minimizing computation.

Week 8 – Data Structures
Stack, Queue, and Heap operations.
Example: Managing books, queues at a bus stop, and task prioritization.

Week 9 – Number Theory
The Sieve of Eratosthenes and Euclidean Algorithm.
Example: Generating primes and calculating GCDs.

Week 10 – Combinatorics
Permutations and Combinations.
Example: Arranging and selecting letters (A, B, C).

Week 11 – Information & Web Algorithms
Huffman Coding and PageRank.
Example: Compressing messages and ranking web pages.

Week 12 – Cryptography & Wrap-Up
RSA Encryption and a course summary.
Example: Encrypting and decrypting a message with simple keys.
